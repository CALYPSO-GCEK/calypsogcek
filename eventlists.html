                    <p>A solar eclipse, a rare and breathtaking phenomenon, graced the sky with its presence. To witness this awe-inspiring event, a group of 10-20 students gathered together on the terrace of the PG block from 5pm-6pm.</p>
    
                    <p>To ensure the safety of everyone's eyes, the event organizers provided sun glass filters for everyone to witness the solar eclipse safely. 
                        The students were mesmerized as they watched the moon obscure the sun, creating a remarkable ring of fire effect. The sky turned a deep shade of orange, and the temperature dropped, creating a surreal atmosphere that the students would remember for a lifetime.
                    </p>
                    <p>The solar eclipse was a rare and unique experience that brought everyone together to witness the beauty and magic of the universe. It was a reminder of how small we are in this vast universe and how extraordinary events like these can unite us all.</p>

                        students and execs.
                        The program began with an interesting lecture by the founder of Astro Payyanur. After dinner at 7:30
                        P.M.,
                        we visited the mini planetarium and learned about various constellations. We returned to the seminar
                        hall for the next session,
                        but our star gazing was unfortunately interrupted due to cloudy skies. The next session on astrology
                        was held
                        at 4:30 A.M. with Mr. Gangadharan, who emphasized the importance of not blindly following
                        astrological beliefs. </p>

                    <h3>Space Hunt</h3>
                    <p>We organized an electrifying virtual space quiz competition titled Space Hunt, hosted by Calypso – the Space Club of GCEK. The event was designed with a dual objective: to ignite curiosity about the cosmos and to challenge participants through an immersive online experience.</p>
                    <p>Space Hunt was structured into two impactful rounds, both conducted virtually to ensure maximum reach and participation.</p>
                    <h4>Round 1 – The Cosmic Chase</h4>
                    <p>The first round was an engaging puzzle trail where participants navigated through cryptic, space-themed clues scattered across a digital landscape. The clues were embedded in riddles, visual puzzles, and encrypted messages that tested logical reasoning and out-of-the-box thinking. Each clue brought them closer to the final code—a virtual “cosmic treasure” waiting to be unlocked.</p>
                    <p>Participants had to collaborate, decode, and race against time to complete the challenge. This round blended space trivia with problem-solving intensity, ensuring a fun-yet-challenging entry.</p>
